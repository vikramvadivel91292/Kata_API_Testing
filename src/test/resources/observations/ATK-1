Title: Unable to create negative scenario for 409 error validation
Request Body:
{
    "bookingid": 5,
    "roomid": 6,
    "firstname": "ABC",
    "lastname": "DEF",
    "depositpaid": true,
    "bookingdates": {
        "checkin": "2025-11-01",
        "checkout": "2025-11-02"
    }
}

Tried by giving the existing resource details in request, got 409 Conflict "Failed to create booking" in response.
But after sometime, for same data, able to create a new resource since it is an open api.
So couldn't able to add this validation in negative test.
